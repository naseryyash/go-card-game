This project is my first project in Golang. It is aimed at teaching the basics of Golang to beginners. 

It covers a wide variety of Go syntax and concepts, some of which are as follows:

1) Basic Go syntax 
			- packages
			- import statements
			- function declarations & calls
			- return types
			- arrays & slices
			- strings
			- for loops
			- if else blocks
			- nil (null from Java)
			- type conversion
			- errors
		2) Go Types 
			- how to declare types in Go and how they work
		3) Receiver Functions 
			- definition & use
		4) Standard Library Packges
			- ioutil package for file operations
			- strings
			- os package
			- math package
			- time package
		5) Random Number Generation
			- with a time stamp much like Java
		6) Testing in Golang
			- test function name conventions
			- cleanup in tests

Hope this project helps any person trying to step into the world of Go. Although it has pretty basic functionality, still it covers a wide variety of concepts.

Lookout for many more such cool projects by me in the future!! Happy Learning!!
