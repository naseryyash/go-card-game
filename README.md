# go-card-game
This project is my first project in Golang. It is aimed at teaching the basics of Golang to beginners.  

It covers the following Go syntax and concepts:  

1) Basic Go syntax  
	- packages  
	- import statements  
	- function declarations & calls  
	- return types  
	- arrays & slices  
	- strings  
	- for loops  
	- if else blocks  
	- nil (null from Java)  
	- type conversion  
	- errors  
2) Go Types  
	- how to declare types in Go and how they work  
3) Receiver Functions  
	- definition & use  
4) Standard Library Packges  
	- ioutil package for file operations  
	- strings  
	- os package  
	- math package  
	- time package  
5) Random Number Generation  
	- with a time stamp much like Java  
6) Testing in Golang  
	- test function name conventions  
	- cleanup in tests

Hope this project helps any person trying to step into the world of Go. Although it has pretty basic functionality, still it covers a wide variety of concepts.  

Lookout for many more such cool projects by me in the future!! Happy Learning!!   

PS - I used VSCode as a code editor to open this project, but you can use any other code editor of your choice supporting Go
